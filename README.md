# How Containers Actually Work
This repository contains the source code and scripts I used to create the demo content in my presentation "How Containers Actually Work".  The topic of the presentation is explaining that containers are not lightweight virtual machines they are in fact processes that make use of a number of Linux kernel features to provide isolation and resource management.

I've given this presentation at the [Docker Glasgow MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/DockerGlasgow/) and the [Hewlett Packard Enterprise Technology and Solutions Summit](https://starcite.smarteventscloud.com/rsvp/invitation/invitation.asp?donotrefresh=1).  If you're interested I might be able to deliver the presentation at your event or meetup, drop me a note at the email address below.
